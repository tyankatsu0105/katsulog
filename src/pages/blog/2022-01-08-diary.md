  Watching a movie at the theater
---
We watched "matrix resurrections" at the theater in Hakata.  
This movie takes about 2 hours but it felt like a blink of an eye to me.  
I was so enjoyed because I already watched all films of "matrix".  
And I was enjoyed watching movie at the theater because I hadn't been to a movie theater in years.
