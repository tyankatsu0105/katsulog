Today is a holiday in Japan. It's called "A day of an adult."  On the day, almost cities hold the ceremony for people who have already become 20 years old and soon.
Generally, This day is a joyous day. However some people drive with careless and the noisy sound of cars. These people say, "Until the end of the day, I am not an adult. So I am allowed to do anything Because I am not an adult!!" That's interesting.  
But I can't understand that. No one is allowed to cause trouble.  
I think mass media cause this happening because almost mass media reports their behavior every year.
