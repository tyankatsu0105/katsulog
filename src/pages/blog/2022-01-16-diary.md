description: trip - Kurokawa hot springs
---
I had traveled Yamamizuki Kurokawa hot springs Kumamoto prefecture for two days.
Yamamizuki's hot springs are very comfortable. Especially, the open-air bus with very comfortable sounds by nature is very cool. It let me relax.
In this season, Kurokawa hot springs hold an event that [Yuakari](https://www.kurokawaonsen.or.jp/event/yuakari/).
It was so amazing as many beautiful monuments with warm light!
Many tourists took pictures. And also, I did it.
A cafe's owner said me "You should come in October as there is an event."
I'd like to go there in that month.
