XCodeで詰まったので`sudo xcode-select --reset`からの`sudo xcodebuild -license`したらできた。  
モンハンの二つ名ヴァルハザク強かった。いつのまにかキャンプ送りでびっくりした。  
関数型プログラミングJS本眺めてて思った「わからん」はコードを実際に書けば解決されそうなので、読み直しつつコードを書いていっている。  
英語の勉強中。  
I have enough money to buy the book.  
My uncle has two farms in Texas.  
You must be hungry by now.  
I am the father of two children.  
They are very busy these days.  
The bank is just around the corner.  
Columbus was sure that the world was round.  
Several of the children were afraid of the doctor.  
Mr. Wilson has been popular among students for years.  
He became ill  during his trip.  
His father's death changed him into a stronger person.  
My grandfather died last year.  
Gas prices suddenly dropped last week.  
The boy almost fell out his bicycle.  
Peter Pan never grows old.  
Bad things can happen, even to good people  
You must keep quiet at the library.  
A man can't live without hope.  
I lost my blue globe at the party.
