These days, sometimes I suddenly cry with shaking my heart.  
Because I often think about whether I can love the one.  
I don't know how can I do about that.  
And I don't know anyone who I'd like to call help.  
So I often cry alone.  
Do most people how to treat their minds?  
I'd like to know how to do that.
