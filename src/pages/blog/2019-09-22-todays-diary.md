I was watching "July 22" on Netflix.  
I didn't know Ut√∏ya. It's an island in Norway.  
I was shocked when kids were shooted by the murder.  
However, when watched that victim boy get over the shooting, I understood that  this movie was not tragedy.  

Today's english  
The police arrived at the scene quickly.  
The kid blew his nose many times.  
We have to carry all of those boxes to the car.  
He caught a fish with his hands.  
The boy climbed up to the top of the tree.  
I don't close this door on hot days.  
Did you come here by subway or by taxi?  
A girl was crying all alone in the middle of the park.  
She was dancing to the music on the radio.  
I usually drink coffee in the morning.  
Perhaps daddy will drive us to the station.  
We ate chocolate cake after dinner.  
Yesterday someone enterd his house througn the kithen window.
