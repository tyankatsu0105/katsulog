description: Eating oyster
---
We went to a oyster hut(Japansese say Kaki-goya) to eat oysters and some kinds of seafood.  
It tastes great. We ate 2kg of oysters, two pieces of scallops, two skewered squid, and three smelt fishes.  
It only cost 4800 yen even though We were so full and satisfied with the taste.  
We talked about "Is there an oyster hut in Denmark?"  
If there are some spots where we can eat some kinds of seafood, We want to visit there.  

Tomorrow is a holiday in Japan.  
So I will read the book that I bought a few days ago.
